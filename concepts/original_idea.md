I want to develop an scientific idea I like to call systemetical societal debt. It's inspired by technical debt, but then applies to (organically developing) societal systems. Basically, it's the costs of doing something late, or at least not on the ideal moment. Kind of the opposite of the first-mover disadvantage (costs of doing things (too) early). It often occurs because by doing this late, you can't have a clean sheet design, have stricter requirements due to existing parties having a stake and/or scarce resources already being allocated. It might also be related to NIMBY. The costs are either carried (increasingly) forward by society (by not having the resource, like opportunity costs) or payed later at a (way) higher amount. A complexity might be that a missed opportunity isn't always clear, because the future is uncertain, calling for (deep) uncertainty exploration and/or resilience analysis to effectively use this concept. It does require a clear picture on future societal benefits and costs.
