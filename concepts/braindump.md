I might have discovered a novel scientific idea, or at least an aggregation which combines several scientific ideas in a novel way. I'm now discussing an outline for a potential paper on the idea.

The idea is societal systemic debt. Basically, it's the debt that accumulates in organically evolving societal systems. Or, in simple words, the cost of society evolving in unintended ways.

Other ideas included are path dependence, lock-in, not-in-my-backyardism, resilience, path dependency, deep uncertainty. The goal is really to integrate that into one conceptual framework in which policy makers and policy engineers can think and act and actually try to solve some of these problems.

So, in outline:

Start with a problem statement. It should include some examples of long-term accumulating societal debt that were never intended. This is important. If it was a fixed, simple system, it could be a conscious choice to take some technical debt to get something done quickly instead of nothing done at all. But here, it's really that society evolves in the meantime in a way that makes a future solution costlier or raises the opportunity cost.

Some quick examples I can think of right now: in infrastructure, if you don't plan a good public transport system, it's very difficult to retrofit that on an existing city. So many land use and urban sprawl and problems of cities can in some way tie into this.

The nitrogen crisis is probably way cheaper to solve earlier. It's also really unintended because we weren't conscious of it. PFAS, forever chemicals, plastics, could tie into this. And probably concepts on education and resistance, or reliance, or resilience of political systems against coups and that kind of stuff. So, it can be a really wide concept as long as there are some uncontrollable, or at least difficult to control, societal evolutions going on organically, spread among many actors, spread among a complex system.

And sometimes, if you have a first mover advantage, in this case, probably the opposite, where you have a late mover disadvantage because of past resources or decisions, that's possible.

So, for a layout, start with the problem statement. Fuel ideas that are described there, and then go into some of the underlying principles. Maybe before quickly introducing the concept, or maybe first the individual principles, that order can switch depending on what makes the most sense.

Path dependency is an obvious one. Future uncertainty is an obvious one. Opportunity windows and political momentum are an obvious one. Lock-in effects, probably sinking costs, and something about the cost of the future being less value than the cost right now. And probably many more, but it should tie into a core concept, not too much. It should be like what's the matter, not everything you can think of.

Then it should go on to how it all ties together in this idea called systemic societal debt, or societal systemic debt, or maybe a new name. And that should present a framework, an overarching mental map, everything, what it should look like. But like an overarching concept to think about these kinds of problems.

Then it should move on to an analysis of why it currently goes wrong. I think that's going to be different stages. It might be just ignorance, not knowing that there will be a future debt created by the current actions or current inactions. It might be not bringing together the right people or the right support or technical development. It's tied really to path dependence. Some resources not being present, no political will. But it should build up. First, you have to know that something is wrong. Then you have to know how the future will develop. Then you have to know what societal costs, current decision or indecision, will project on that future. And finally, there can be, even if you have perfect information, perfect benefits, but still consciously choose not to do the long-term optimal thing. But that's a conscious choice. And I think now many problems are not conscious choices to move them forward. I think, as the nitrogen crisis currently is, we willingly trade some biodiversity for current agricultural output. But in many other cases, only now the effects of forever chemicals appear, and the effects of lead a few decades ago. There are many other.

It also should not just strictly focus on, "Oh, we didn't know it and we did some harm." But it is one layer, one component of that.

Okay, so then we have the stages in where it can originate from. And I think then there should be a general strategy on how to, at least scientifically, and maybe also politically, prevent societal systemic debt. That probably starts with good problem analysis, having a scientific base, keeping that on par, then making sure that the knowledge is there, that the knowledge is spread to the right actors and people, that it's a general enough known field that you can actually argue and debate it in political circles.

So, it's also probably a lot about the knowledge propagation in the solution phase. Because I think this is, okay, maybe I want to focus on the unintended systemic societal debt because if it's intended, it's a political choice and that's at some point okay. Then we choose to ruin future generations, or we choose to move the costs forward, or not allow people to enjoy some opportunity costs in the long term. But in this case, it's really, okay, we either don't know, we don't want to know. And the knowledge framework just isn't there to think about these kind of complex problems. Something like that. And I think that could be quite an interesting paper on its own.
